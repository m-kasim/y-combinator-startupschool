How to Evaluate Startup Ideas

0. General:
- YCombinator does fund startups with low or no revenue (just idea)
- Reddit was funded by YCombinator (without a single line of code)

1. How you will become a big company (1B)?
- Startup = Grow very quickly
- Investors want companies with evidence that it can grow quickly
- The investor bets are the ones which are not obvious
- startup idea = hypothesis why a company can grow quickly
- do not overdescribe parts

2. How to evaluate a startup:

- [PROBLEM]: What is the setting for the problem?
*) good problems are popular (growing market, at least 1M users)
*) growing (+20% a year)
*) expensive to solve (where the law has changed)
*) mandatory
*) urgent
*) frequent

- [SOLUTION]: What is the solution within this environment?
*) DO NOT START WITH THE SOLUTION. START WITH THE PROBLEM! (find a way to apply blockchain?!)

- [WHY]
*) Why is this solution going to work?
*) What is your unfair advantage?
*) It has to be related to growth
*) You need why.

3. Types of unfair advantages:
    1. Founders:    One of the few people that can solve the problem
    2. Market:      Grows 20%
    3. Product:     Your product is 10X better/cheaper than alternatives
    4. Acquisition: If you can get only customers through paid Ads, this advantage is going to dwindle when competitors come
                    Word-of-mouth: You have to acquire customers without paying for getting them
    5. Monopoly:    Do you have a monopoly? Can competitors defeat you?
    *) marketplace:     the first who does it wins all
    *) network-effect:  the company gets stronger, as the market grows

4. Beliefs:
- Can the team build/do the product?
- How well you can do sales/convince people?
