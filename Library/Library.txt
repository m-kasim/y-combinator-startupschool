1. Why smart people have bad ideas? Make something people want!
- Is this something people will pay for?
- Gradually it dawned on us that instead of trying to make Web sites for people
who didn't want them, we could make sites for people who did.
- If you're going to spend years working on something, you'd think it might be wise
to spend at least a couple days considering different ideas,
instead of going with the first that comes into your head.
- Part of the problem is that big projects tend to grow out of small ones.
- Unpleasant work pays => Supply and demand
- The most extreme case is developing programming languages, which doesn't pay at all,
 because people like it so much they do it for free.
- The purpose of a company, and a startup especially, is to make money
- In fact there is no such thing as "business."
There's selling, promotion, figuring out what people want, deciding how much to charge,
customer support, paying your bills, getting customers to pay you, getting incorporated,
raising money, and so on.
- How to win friends: how to see things from other people's point of view,
instead of thinking only of yourself.

2. Startup ideas:
- The fact is, most startups end up nothing like the initial idea.
It would be closer to the truth to say the main value of your initial idea is that,
in the process of discovering it's broken, you'll come up with your real idea.

- Treating a startup idea as a question changes what you're looking for.
If an idea is a blueprint, it has to be right. But if it's a question, it can be wrong,
so long as it's wrong in a way that leads to more ideas.

- The opposite extreme would be a well-paying but boring job at a big company.
Big companies are biased against new technologies, and the people you'd meet there would be wrong too

- I don't think people consciously realize this, but one reason downwind jobs like churning out Java
for a bank pay so well is precisely that they are downwind.
The market price for that kind of work is higher because it gives you fewer options for the future.
A job that lets you work on exciting new stuff will tend to pay less, because part of the compensation
is in the form of the new skills you'll learn.

- Even Einstein needed people to bounce ideas off.

- This is one reason Y Combinator has a rule against investing in startups with only one founder.
Practically every successful company has at least two.
And because startup founders work under great pressure, it's critical they be friends.

- One of the most useful mental habits I know I learned from Michael Rabin:
that the best way to solve a problem is often to redefine it.
You need a big prime number? Those are pretty expensive.
How about if I give you a big number that only has a 10 to the minus 100 chance of not being prime?
Would that do? Well, probably; I mean, that's probably smaller than the chance that I'm imagining all this anyway.

- Complications lead to Death.

- A free market interprets monopoly as damage and routes around it

03. How to invent the future I:
- Don't live in the present. Live in the future
- Forget your ego, only what works matters
- Good people create good projects. The reverse is never true.
- Fund people, not projects!
- WRONG WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT: Let's see what technologies are available and what we can with them
- RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT: What is the vision for the future? What is the problem? We don't know how to solve it!
- "We don't know what will be needed. If we need to make a new integrated circuit, we will do it.". And they did.
- Today people design hardware for people to buy, then put some software in it to make it nice
- Back in the day, people first designed software, then designed the hardware that will optimally run it
- WORK ON THE ACTUAL BIG HUMAN PROBLEMS, not what is going to get funded or paid
- Wayne Gretzky had the highest amount of goals in hockey (and also the highest amount of misses)
- A good hockey player goes where the puck is. A great hockey player goes where the puck will be

04. How to invent the future II:
- Computer-to-Human interface is very important!
- Create an industry, not a business

- LEAD:     IQ
- SILVER:   Knowledge
- CONTEXT:  GOLD!

- You can be the smartest of the top 100 smart people in the room. But the rest 99 united are still smarter than you...
- No idea is truly original. The PC was built back in 1950-1960s.

- Don't work on bad or mediocre ideas

- Eye: We have an eye sensor, and an eye image in the brain (which "see" different images)

- Beliefs = Private universe

- Abnormal/different thoughts are often thought to be crazy

- The environment is weak. And if you learn (from) the environment, you are going to be weak...

- No healthcare company is interested in you being healthy, because that way they can't earn money
 by "making you healthy"s
- If you look after 150 years to the present day, you will realize a lot of things today were ridiculous
- The first 15 hires are the most important
- Beware of people who are smart, but want to tell you how smart they are!
- RED FLAG: "Oh, no, no, no, no. Trust me. I'm a good guy" => SHOW ME THE DATA (proof)
