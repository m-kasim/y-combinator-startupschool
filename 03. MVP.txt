MVP: How to Plan an MVP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hHMwLxN6EM

0. General:
- Give users something very simple, and see if they use it at all (if they see any value in it)
- Avoid 3 years of research and development
- Mysterious users: If you are building something for a "mysterious user"... think again!
- BIG VISION and SMALL MVP
- VP and Investor pitches should be different

1. MVP: DOES IT SOLVE THE PROBLEM I WANT IT TO SOLVE?
- VALIDATE EARLY: LAUNCH SOMETHING QUICKLY!
- GET SOME INITIAL CUSTOMERS (ANYONE) - many failed startups fail to interact with any users at all
- AGAIN, TALK TO USERS and GET FEEDBACK
- You can talk to customer all day, but without a product, you can't learn anything
- Rarely a product is what the initial vision was
- Never ask users for features or what they want.
- Ask them for their problems. You have to figure out what fixes them
- Do they want to pay for the feature?
- People wont stop using the product if it's good

2. LEAN MVP:
- Startup page and a Spreadsheet
- GET THERE FAST
- Only the most important thing

- Stripe, AirBnB and Twitch (Justin.tv) had very bad initial versions, but they had traction!
- Stripe founders came to the office of first clients and integrated it for them (because they had no product)

3. Heavy MVP:
- Regulation: If a lot of regulation is required
- Hard-tech / Moonshots: Rockets or infrastructure or etc.
- In these cases => build a website which tells what you do

4. Launches:
- No one remembers when Google, Twitter, Facebook launched
- It's all about having paying customers!

5. Hacks:
- Timebox things
- Write down your specification
- Remove unneeded features

6. PRODUCT <-> MARKET FIT:
- [definition]: the moment you no longer search for users or optimize the product, but actually you have _too many_ users
- few startups gets product-market fit
