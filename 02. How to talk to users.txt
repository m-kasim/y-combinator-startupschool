0. General:
- The best founders maintain direct connection to users for lifetime
- You cannot outsource talking to customers
- The engineers have to know what the users want
- User interaction: UI of products get worse if the team does not interact with the actual users for 6 weeks
- Surveys: they are not very accurate
- User segmentation: Segment your users to groups: "these pay more", "these are hesitant"...
- Beta: Betas are useful to test (I know it has bugs, but I built it in a week)
- Sales: Good salesmen listen, understand and then solve the problem of the user
- MEGA TRICK - THE HACK TOGETHER:
Pack it, write your company name on it (even if it don't exist), and TRY TO SELL IT. The best way to understand if it works!
- LANDING PAGE: You can understand 90% of the interest with a landing page... (if it even exists)
- Users will contact you themselves, only by seeing a page, if they have an interest in the product...
- Instagram: Advertising on Instagram is real and expensive
- Engaging users: Facebook groups, Reddits and etc. and position yourself as an expert

1. User interview:
- Do not pitch the product
- Do not talk about "what it could be?"
- Talk about things which already exist and the users have experienced
- Learn about their motivations

2. 5 great questions to users:
[1] What is the hardest part? What is the user's pain point?

[2] Tell me about the last time you had this problem?

[3] Why was that hard?
*) Customers will buy something which SOLVES A PROBLEM

[4] What have you tried to solve the problem?
*) If the user has not tried something else to solve the problem, perhaps this is not a painful enough problem...
*) Is the user already trying to solve the problem actively?

[5] What don't you love about the current solution you have tried? => REQUESTED FEATURES

3. Talking to users is useful at all stages:
[1]: Got idea?          Find users with this problem!
- talk to yourself, friends, co-workers
- just show up and talk to people
- keep notes, be casual, respect their time

[2]: Build prototype?   Best firs customer!
- How much does this problem cost them?
- How frequent the problem occurs?
- How large is their budget?

[3]: Launched?          Find product-market fit!

4. FIGURE OUT YOUR BEST FIRST CUSTOMER!

5. PRODUCT MARKET FIT:
- When you no longer need to PUSH the product. PEOPLE WANT IT THEMSELVES!
- People MUST WANT TO PAY your product
- HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU CAN NO LONGER USE THE PRODUCT? Not good, Terrible, N/A.

6. Other:
- Phone contact is useful when signing up - you can talk to them directly
- Don't ask users directly "What do you want?"
- "Pay 5$ more, if you want this feature on your account" even before the feature is ever done to figure out who really wants it
- Discard compliments, they are not useful!
- Avoid unspecific things
